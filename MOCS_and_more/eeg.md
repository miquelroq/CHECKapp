## What can be diagnosed by EEG

*Abnormal EEG results may be due to:*

 - epilepsy or another seizure disorder
 - abnormal bleeding or hemorrhage
 - sleep disorder
 - encephalitis (swelling of the brain)
 - tumor
 - dead tissue due to a blockage of blood flow
 - migraines
 - alcohol or drug abuse
 - head injury

## What can the EEG show?

*The EEG shows patterns of normal or abnormal brain electrical activity. Some abnormal patterns may occur with a number of different conditions, not just seizures.*

 - For example, certain types of waves may be seen after **head trauma, stroke, brain tumor, or seizures**. A common example of this type is called **"slowing,"** in which the **rhythm of the brain waves is slower than would be expected** for the patient's age and level of alertness.

 - Certain other patterns indicate a **tendency toward seizures**. Your doctor may refer to these waves as "epileptiform abnormalities" or "epilepsy waves." **They can look like spikes, sharp waves, and spike-and-wave discharges.**

 - If you have **partial seizures, spikes and sharp waves** on the EEG in a specific area of the brain, such as the a temporal lobe, can show where the seizures are coming from.   

 - Generalized **epilepsy** is suggested by **spike-and-wave discharges that are widely spread over both side of the brain**, especially if they begin in both sides at the same time.
