#AI and machine learning class

##Introduction

In this document we'll explore what is AI and Machine Learning, how it started and what are their applications. 
We'll start by giving a simple *Overview*, where we'll talk about the history of it, give some examples of daily apps we use that implement some form of AI and machine learning and talk about the differerent types of AI and AI algorithms.
Next, we'll dive into some *AI algorithms* in both the area of Searching (Procura informada e não informada) and Learning (Aprendizagem por reforço e Aprendizagem por exemplos) from which point we'll procede for *Machine Learning 101*. 
After that, we'll expose some *Examples related to the Health sector* and lastly give some practical examples of *Useful resources* to implement Machine Learning in your app such a couple of Python Libs and DeepLearning4j.
We hope that this class contributes to wonder you with the amazing world of AI and at the same time empower you with some great tools that might be useful for your project .
