API Functioning notes

Idea:

GET endpoint that allows:
    * passing the BITalino collected data as parameter
    * returning the resulting report
    * this report should be able to be parsed by the BaseValuesHandler
        ...meaning
        

    * Overall scores can be calculated in the device
    * when the details are returned, BaseValuesHandler knows the ideal score and calculates differences
    or something


DATA TO BE RETURNED:
    * BPM
    * FREQ
    * BREATH
    * BMI
    * FAT
    * MDF
    * MNF
    * RMS
    * RRMS
    * ALPHA
    * BETA
    * DELTA
    * THETA
